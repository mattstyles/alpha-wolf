## Wolf traits

* Metabolism -> higher bestows better speed, but increased speed also increases food consumption.
* Fur -> higher means they can withstand colder temperatures, but be more likely to be hunted.
* Aggression -> higher bestows better attack damage, but also dictates how likely they are to go looking for a fight. Fighting can be a source of food (prey will bestow food, hunters will not, aggression does not differentiate).
* Wanderlust -> higher will mean they spend less time in caves and more time exploring

## World traits

* Hunters -> frequency of hunters, whose only job is to kill wolves. Will prefer to kill wolves with higher fur yield.
* Prey -> Food source for wolves.

* Mountains -> Cold, but hunters will avoid mountains unless actively hunting a target. If temperature drops too far wolves will take damage and will seek to raise their temperature.
* Hills -> Neutral tile, slightly colder than plains.
* Plains -> Neutral tile. Hunters and prey prefer plains unless actively hunting.
* Caves -> Wolves can completely hide in caves, active hunters will lose them as a target.
* Rivers -> Wolves can move without penalty, hunters and prey are slowed in rivers.
